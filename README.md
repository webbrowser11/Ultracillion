# Ultracillion
Ultracillion is a number invented by graham terpstra, becuase he was freaking around with python on his first day of summer 2025.
He made this number at around 8:05 PM on 12/6/2025 (UK time) or 6/12/2025 (US time).
The number is made up of 2 times itself almost 1 million times (as thought by him).
It consists of a 2 followed by ulcountabel amounts of random didgits.
This number is basically N = 2 to the power of K. K standing for a giant number.

# Why?
Because he wanted to create a number so weird and useless no one would think about it.
